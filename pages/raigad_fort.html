      <h3><p class="description">The Chit Darwaja is located at the foothills of the fort which is near the village of
         Pachad. From here the visitors start on their foot journey to the Khoob Ladha Buruj. And then they reach the
         main entrance to the fort, the Maha Darwaja.

         The massive entrance to the fort reflects the glory of the Marathas. There are ropeway facilities that you can
         use to directly go to the top of the fort if you do not want to climb 1737 steps. It will take you to the top
         of the fort directly near Mena Darwaja. That will lead you to the Rani Vasa. Towards the right of the Mena
         Darwaja, there is the office complex of the kingâ€™s secretaries. You can also visit there.</p></h3>
