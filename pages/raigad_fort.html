      <h3>
         <p class="description">The Chit Darwaja is located at the foothills of the fort which is near the village of
            Pachad. From here the visitors start on their foot journey to the Khoob Ladha Buruj. And then they reach the
            main entrance to the fort, the Maha Darwaja.

            The massive entrance to the fort reflects the glory of the Marathas. There are ropeway facilities that you
            can
            use to directly go to the top of the fort if you do not want to climb 1737 steps. It will take you to the
            top
            of the fort directly near Mena Darwaja. That will lead you to the Rani Vasa. Towards the right of the Mena
            Darwaja, there is the office complex of the king’s secretaries. You can also visit there.</p>

         <p class="description">Palkhi Darwaja is just in front of the queen chambers. It served as a special doorway
            for Shivaji Maharaj’s convoy. There are three dark chambers to the right of this doorway that are believed
            to be the granaries of the fort by historians.</p>
